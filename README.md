## Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains the programming codes used to solve the OpenAI Gym LunarLander-v2 (two independent methods) and CartPole-v1 environments with the use of reinforcement learning.

List of codes:
1. main.py: main file to run both environments (comment out the other)
2. wrapper.py: useful functions for the environment wrappers

3. cartpole_wrapper.py: wrapper for the CartPole environment
4. qleaner.py: Q-learner to solve the CartPole environment

5. lunarlander_wrapper.py: wrapper to solve the LunarLander environment (first method)
6. my_agent.py: Deep Q-learner to solve the LunarLander environment (first method)

7. lunarlander_wrapper2.py: wrapper to solve the LunarLander environment (second method)
8. my_agent2.py: Q-learner combined with multiple neural networks to solve the LunarLander environment (second method)
